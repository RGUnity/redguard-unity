# Redguard Unity

Redguard Unity is an open source project that intends to port _The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard_ to the Unity game engine.

Despite beeing developed by a different team, it has similar goals to _Daggerfall Unity_ and aims for a faithful recreation of the original game in a new engine. It will feature vastly improved performance, more responsive controls, better graphical fidelity, and many other fixes to make the game more enjoyable.

## Project Status
This project is still in the earliest stages. At the moment, the focus is on making asset loaders such as for 3D models and textures.

We are also developing a standalone modelviewer application, which you can download in the [releases page](https://github.com/RGUnity/redguard-unity/releases)
