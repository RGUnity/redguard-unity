# Redguard Unity

Redguard Unity is an open source project that intends to port _The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard_ to the Unity game engine.

In many ways, it has similar goals to _Daggerfall Unity_, and aims for an equally faithful recreation of the original game in a new engine, but with several modernizations and improvements.

Despite the similar names, it is made by a different team than Interkarma's Daggerfall Unity.
