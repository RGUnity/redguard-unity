# Redguard Unity
Redguard Unity is an open source project that intends to port _The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard_ to the Unity game engine.

In many ways, it has similar goals to _Daggerfall Unity_, and aims for an equally faithful recreation of the original game in a new engine, but with several modernizations and improvements.

Despite the similar names, it is made by a different team than Interkarma's Daggerfall Unity.

## Project Status
This project is still in the earliest stages, far away from even beeing considered an "alpha". The current release(s) only show some remade gameplay mechanics in an isolated test scene.
